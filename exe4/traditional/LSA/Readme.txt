Landmarks-based Kernelized Subspace Alignment for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation:
First select the landmarks using choose_landmarks method. 
You might need to change the threshold for the distributions overlapping.
Then call the LSA with the selected landmarks.
The diemsnion of subspace alignment step is also a hyper parameter. Please contact us for more informations on how to choose it.
All the methods normalize the data first so you don't need to do so.
